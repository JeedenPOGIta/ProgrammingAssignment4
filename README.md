# PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT NO. 4 <br>

<div align="justify">

Welcome! This programming assignment focuses on the use of Data Wrangling and Data Visualization in Python. <br>

### [OBJECTIVES]

1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data <br>
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will
be used in data wrangling and data visualization <br><br>

## [PROBLEM 1] 

Before we proceed, it is essential that we first import the PANDAS  functions to our Python code: <br>

<br>

```
#import pandas into the code
import pandas as pd
```

<br>



<br>

```

```

<br>



a.  <br>


```

```
<br>

SAMPLE OUTPUT:


<br>

b.  <br>


```

```

SAMPLE OUTPUT:


<br>

With that, I was able to  <br>

## [END OF REPOSITORY]

And that is a wrap! This is the end of my repository on our programming assignment 34. Please let me 
know if you have any feedback, tips, tricks, or suggestions for improving my coding efficiency! 
Thank you once again! <br>

## [ACKNOWLEDGEMENT] 
I would like to acknowledge Ms. Ma. Madecheen Pangaliman and Mr. Nikko John Lobos for providing knowledge about Python data wrangling
and data visualization and for providing the practice problems presented in the repository. Thank you to both of you!
